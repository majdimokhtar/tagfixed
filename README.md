The error occurs because when you're trying to create/connect tags during article creation, there's a race condition between creating new tags and connecting them to the article. Let's modify the tag creation and article update process to handle this more reliably.
Modified Article Tag Creation ProcessClick to open code
The key changes I made are:

Instead of just creating the tag and assuming it worked, we now wait for the create operation to complete and use the returned tag
Added a validation step that ensures all tags (both existing and newly created) are actually in the database before attempting to update the article
Use the validated tags for the article update instead of the original tags

This should resolve the error because:

It ensures tags are fully created before trying to connect them to the article
It double-checks that all tags exist in the database before the update
It uses the actual database records rather than the input data for the update

The error you were seeing happened because the article update was trying to connect to tags that weren't fully created in the database yet. This new approach ensures everything exists before making the connections.
Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail or help you implement additional error handling?
